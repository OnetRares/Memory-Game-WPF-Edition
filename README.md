# 🧠 Memory Game - WPF Edition 🎮
Welcome to the Memory Game WPF Edition! 🔥 If you love challenges and want to put your memory to the test, this game is perfect for you! 

# 🎮 Description
Memory Game is a classic game where you need to find matching pairs of hidden cards. 🃏💡 Each pair of cards has the same image, and your goal is to uncover all pairs as quickly as possible! ⏱️ In this version, the game is built using WPF and C#, and your progress is saved so you can continue where you left off! 😎

# 🏗️ Architecture
The game follows the MMVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture for a clean separation of concerns:

Model: Represents the game logic, card matching, and progress saving.

View: The graphical user interface (GUI), built with WPF and XAML, which provides an intuitive and interactive experience.

ViewModel: The bridge between the Model and the View, handling user interactions and updating the View with data from the Model.

This pattern ensures that the game's logic is independent of the UI, making it easier to test and maintain. 🛠️
